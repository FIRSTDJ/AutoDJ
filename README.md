# FRCDJ

This app will fill the role of a skilled DJ to provide a slightly more dynamic feeling than a playlist on shuffle when a DJ is unavailable (Over half of Michiganâ€™s events as of 2017). This app replicates the music selection technique that is taught to FRC DJs in the state of Michigan. This project will be open source and freely distributed for use at FIRST Robotics Competition events around Michigan and the rest of the world.
